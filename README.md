## Project Overview

The project aims to provide insights into climate change impacts by analyzing temperature and rainfall data from 1981 to 2022. It involves:
- Trend Analysis
- Seasonal Decomposition
- Anomaly Detection
- Predictive Modeling (Polynomial Regression & ARIMA)

## Data

The dataset used contains climate records from 1981 to 2022, organized by year, with monthly and annual values for various climate parameters. Ensure your data file (`Climate.csv`) is placed in the same directory as the code files.

## Requirements

Install the following Python libraries:
```bash
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn statsmodels
